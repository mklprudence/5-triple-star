<p>NB Please do NOT name the illustration files as <code>main.pdf</code>, since that is agreed to be the name for the temporary builds of the documents and will be ignored by git due to our current <code>.gitignore</code> settings. Also, try not to add any binary files that are subject to changes (since they will be stored in the repository forever).</p>

## LaTeX

### Setup

#### Download
<p>The easiest way to get TeX is to <a heref=http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html>install TeXLive</a>. This works on all platforms and should provide all you need by default.</p>

<p>If you do not want to install all packages (occupying some gigabytes of disk space) from CTAN defaulted by TeXLive, you can try the <a href=https://miktex.org/>MiKTeX distribution</a>. It will only install the basic facilities to run TeX, and required packages will be installed on-the-fly. However, due to this quite unique feature, compilation speed is compromised to a certain degree. MiKTeX is also cross-platform now.</p>

<p>On Macintosh, a distribution called <a href=https://tug.org/mactex/>MacTeX</a> is also available. It is very much like TeXLive, but its interface is optimized for Macintosh system.</p>

<p>Some other distributions are also out there. But these are the most widely-used ones.</p>

#### Usage
<p>TeX is a markup language. You write <code>tex</code> files and compile them to binary formats like <code>dvi</code> or <code>pdf</code>.</p>

<p>LaTeX is a set of macros equipping on plain TeX. This includes the most important <code>\documentclass</code> and <code>\usepackage</code>ï¼Œ which requires <code>cls</code> and <code>sty</code> files respectively. You may use the existing ones or come up with your own. If you choose the latter, it is recommended that you sync those files through all similar stuff in the same subject. E.g. All M2 notes should use the same <code>cls</code> file, <code>fts_ms.cls</code>.</p>

<p>All the notes in this project are supposed to be written in LaTeX. If you want detailed material to learn it, you may consult <a href=https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes>the Overleaf/ShareLaTeX tutorial</a> to get a grip of the idea. If you just want to clarify a few usage problems, you may feel free to search/ask them in <a href=https://www.stackoverflow.com>Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

#### Compile

<p>If you use an LaTeX IDE, you will of course be given compile/view shortcut. Most text editors (like Vim, Emacs, VS Code, etc.) also have plugins that support similar functions.</p>

<p>However, if you insist on managing the command line, there are generally two ways (both require a functioning LaTeX distribution, of course).</p>

<p>Assuming that your main tex file is named <code>main.tex</code>. The play-from-scratch way is to simply use <code>pdflatex main.tex -interaction=nonstopmode</code>. The last argument ensures a similar behaviour of LaTeX compiler to most modern language compilers.</p>

<p>The author (@fivetriplestar) personally recommend using <code>latexmk</code>. It is a <code>perl</code> script which most likely come with most <code>perl</code> distributions. You only need to type <code>latexmk</code> in the working directory and it will take care for the rest.</p>

## Git Workflow

### Setup

#### Download
<p>Several installiation methods work depending on your case.</p>

###### Linux
<p>Use your distribution's package manager to install git. For example, Ubuntu users can use <code>apt-get install git</code>.</p>

###### Native Windows Environment
<p>Install <code>git</code> to your PC from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">this link</a>.</p>

###### MSYS2 on Windows
<p>Install MSYS2 from <a href=https://www.msys2.org/>here</a>. After all packages have been updated by casting <code>pacman -Syuu</code> over again, input <code>pacman -S git</code>.</p>

<p>Note that in this way you can also get a full <code>POSIX</code> environment on Windows, therefore it is expected to take up more disk space.</p>

###### Macintosh
<p>Most likely your system has already installed <code>git</code>. Try running <code>git --version</code> to find out. If there is no <code>git</code> installed, <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/>install it from here</a>.</p>

#### Initialization

<p>Open your favourate terminal (cmd/PowerShell/Git Bash/Msys2 Bash/...) and navigate to the directory you want.</p>

<p>For example, if your want the repository to be at <code>C:/Users/mklprudence/5-triple-star/...</code>, use command <code>cd C:/Users/mklprudence</code></p>

<p>Clone the repository to establish a local repository copy by running command <code>git clone https://github.com/mklprudence/5-triple-star.git</code></p>

<p>Move your cmd working directory into the repository directory by running <code>cd 5-triple-star</code></p>

### Pulling or Fetching a updated copy of file from Github

<p>It is important for you to work on an updated copy both for your own work's sake and for preventing merge conflict. Your current local repository is only a "snapshot" of the online repository at the point of your last git push or git pull. </p>

<p>Open your favourite terminal directly in the 5-triple-star directory.<br>In Windows, open the directory in File Explorer, right-click any empty space and open <code>cmd/PowerShell/...</code>.<br>Or you can open the terminal and navigate to the suitable directory by running command <code>cd path/to/dir</code>.</p>

<p>Run command <code>git pull origin master</code> to pull updated data from the online repository. You maybe prompted to login Github. <br>See section <strong>Caching Password</strong> to avoid having to login every time you git push or pull. </p>

<p><strong>DO NOT conduct a git pull if you have ANY uncommited/unpushed changes to your local repository.</strong> This will result in merge conflict. If a merge conflict occurs, the easiest way to resolve is to re-setup the whole local repo. </p>

### Pushing and Committing to Github

#### Committing

<p>After conducting some changes or adding some files, it is important to group those changes and notify the Git system that there are changes, in the action called <strong>Committing</strong>. </p>

<p>First add the changed file that needed to commit by <code>git add</code>. To add ALL changed file in your working directory to the commit, use <code>git add .</code>. To add only specific file or folder, use <code>git add relative-path-to-file</code> for files and <code>git add relative-path-to-folder/*</code> for folders. </p>

<p>Then conduct the commit by using <code>git commit -m "message-for-the-commit"</code>(with the quotation marks).</p>

<p>If you simply want to commit all the changes, staged or not, in one run, use <code>git commit -a -m "message-for-the-commit"</code></p>

<p>It is recommended that you do not forget to add the <code>-m "message-for-the-commit"</code> part, otherwise, unless you have configured it, <code>vim</code> will be opened for you to input the commit message, which is painful if you have no existing experience of using it.</p>

#### Pushing to remote repository

<p>Committing only creates commit on a local level. Git Push is required to apply the changes to the online repository.</p>

<p>After committing all required changes, do <code>git push origin master</code> to conduct a git push. </p>

<p><strong>Note : </strong>Multiple commits can be pushed at the same time, so feel free to create several commits before applying a final git push. </p>

### Caching Password (Windows)

<p>Password can be cached so that you don't need to login ever time you conduct a git pull or git push. </p>

<p>For detailed instructions, consult <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git">Caching your GitHub password in Git</a></p>
