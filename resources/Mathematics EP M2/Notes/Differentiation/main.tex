    \section*{Introduction}
    What is differentiation? Broadly speaking, differentiation is the study of the so-called \textit{linear approximation} of a function, or, more appetizingly, the tendency of the trend that some function $f(t)$ will take when $t$ increases.\\
    The studies of approximation, trends and optima are long-standing problems of many aspects of development like engineering. The first sight of differentiation can even be found in ancient Greek, Japan and China.\\
    Throughout this note, unless otherwise specified, we are interested in functions $I\to\mathbb R$, where $I$ is a union of some open intervals in $\mathbb R$.
