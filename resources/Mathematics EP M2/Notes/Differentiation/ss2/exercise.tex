1. Find the derivative of $f(x)=1/x$ from first principle.\\
2. find the derivative of $f(x)=\sqrt x$ from first principle.\\
3. (a) By using the sum-to-product formula, find the derivative of $f(x)=\sin(x)$ from first principle.\\
(b) Without using the first principle or anything about limit, find the derivative of $f(x)=\cos(x)$ by using (a).
