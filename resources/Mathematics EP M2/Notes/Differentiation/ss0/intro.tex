What is differentiation?
Broadly speaking, differentiation is the study of the \textit{linear approximation} of a function, or, more appetizingly, the tendency of the trend that some function $f(t)$ will take when $t$ increases.\\
The studies of approximation, trends and optima are long-standing problems of many aspects of development like engineering.
The first sight of differentiation can even be found in ancient Greek, Japan and China.\\
This note is divided into 3 parts.
The first two sections are purely about the intuition behind the definition of derivative (the first principle), for those who think that this definition is weird.
From the third section onwards, we focus on the techniques and laws that can help us differentiate a function without having to cast the first principle.
This includes product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, etc..
The last few sections are about the application of differentiation to different problems, which is a heat topic in exams.\\
Sometimes there are some supplementary information at the end of a section.
All of them are skippable.
However, it is recommended that you follow the chapters in their given order.\\
Throughout this note, unless otherwise specified, all the functions take value in $\mathbb R$ and their domains are open sets (unions of some open intervals) in $\mathbb R$.
